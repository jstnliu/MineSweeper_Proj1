*Nine Tweeper* is a *Mine Sweeper*-inspired game that involves having to clear out all the tiles while avoiding all the 'BOOMS' randomized throughout the board!

### Instructions

Do your best to clear the board without clicking any 'BOOM' spaces, or else it's Game Over!

## Next Steps

---

### *Nine Tweeper* is only at MVP; in the future, I'd like to:

- [ ] Create revealOpenSpaces function that reveals surrounding spaces that don't carry a 'BOOM'
- [ ] Create countBooms function that tells the player how many 'BOOM' spaces are around revealed spaces
- [ ] Following completion of above, remove the 'BOOM' text in respected places
- [ ] Create a difficulty option (ie. Easy: 10 x 10 grid/ 20 grid, Medium: 25 x 25 grid, Hard: 100 x 100 grid)
- [ ] Custom grid size based off of user input
